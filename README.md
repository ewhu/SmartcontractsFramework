**SmartcontractsFramework**
==========================

A Python-based framework for building, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on various blockchain networks.

Detailed Description
--------------------

The SmartcontractsFramework is a comprehensive Python library designed to simplify the process of developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on multiple blockchain platforms. The framework provides a unified API for interacting with different blockchain networks, allowing developers to focus on writing smart contract logic without worrying about the underlying network complexities.

The framework's primary goal is to abstract away the complexities of blockchain development, enabling developers to build robust, scalable, and secure smart contracts with ease. It achieves this by providing a set of pre-built components, tools, and APIs that can be easily integrated into existing development workflows.

One of the key benefits of using the SmartcontractsFramework is its support for multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Tron. This allows developers to deploy their smart contracts on the network of their choice, without having to rewrite the contract code.

Another significant advantage of the framework is its modular design, which enables developers to easily extend or modify the framework to suit their specific needs. This is achieved through a plugin-based architecture, which allows developers to add new features, blockchain networks, or compiler integrations as needed.

Key Features
------------

 **Multi-Blockchain Support**: The framework provides out-of-the-box support for multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Tron.
 **Unified API**: A single, unified API for interacting with different blockchain networks, allowing developers to write smart contract logic without worrying about network-specific complexities.
 **Modular Design**: A plugin-based architecture enables developers to easily extend or modify the framework to suit their specific needs.
 **Smart Contract Compiler Integration**: The framework includes integrations with popular smart contract compilers, such as Solidity and Vyper.
 **Automated Testing**: Built-in support for automated testing of smart contracts using popular testing frameworks like Pytest and Unittest.
 **Web3.js Integration**: Seamless integration with Web3.js, enabling developers to interact with their smart contracts using a familiar API.
 **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation, including API documentation, tutorials, and guides, to help developers get started with the framework.

Technology Stack
----------------

 **Python 3.8+**: The framework is built using Python 3.8 and above, taking advantage of the latest language features and improvements.
 **Web3.py**: A Python implementation of the Web3.js API, providing a seamless integration with the Ethereum blockchain.
 **Solidity**: The framework includes integrations with the Solidity compiler, enabling developers to write smart contracts in Solidity.
 **Vyper**: Support for Vyper, a Python-based smart contract language, is also included.
 **Pytest**: The framework uses Pytest for automated testing of smart contracts.

Installation
------------

To install the SmartcontractsFramework, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.8 or above from the official Python website.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Clone the SmartcontractsFramework repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/SmartcontractsFramework.git`
4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SmartcontractsFramework`
5. Install the framework using pip: `pip install .`

Configuration
-------------

The framework uses environment variables to configure the blockchain network and compiler settings. The following environment variables are supported:

* `SMARTCONTRACT_NETWORK`: The blockchain network to use (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Tron).
* `SMARTCONTRACT_COMPILER`: The smart contract compiler to use (e.g., Solidity, Vyper).

Usage
